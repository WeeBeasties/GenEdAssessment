### Background ###  
This is an R Markdown help document.

### Configuration ###
To ensure maximal reproducibility, the amount of manual configuration needed between different data runs has been minimized. There are really only a few things that you need to do.  

1. Place the new raw data file in the `rawdata` directory.  
1. Open `src/cleanData.R` in an editor of your choice (I use the RStudio IDE).  
1. Change the name of the rawdata file read to the name of the file from step 1 (look for `rawdata <- ""`).  
1. Indicate which outcome is to be assessed for the current semester - 1, 2, 3, or 4 - (look for `outcomeNumber <- ""`).  
1. Save - that is all!! You are now ready to proceed.

### Running makefile Commands ###

**`make`** - default  
**`make help`** - default  
**`make reports`** - generates  
**`make workbooks`** - creates  
**`make emails`** - composes  
**`make clean`** - erases the contents  
**`make all`** - still thinking about this...

```

### The R Scripts ###

**`makeHelp.Rmd`** - When run through `knitr`, this script generates the help document (`help.html`) that you are currently reading. This help file is stored in `output/documents/`.  

**`makeReport.Rmd`** - When run through `knitr`, this script produces brief executive summaries of the rawdata file contents. These reports are generated as Word (`report.docx`), PDF (`report.pdf`), and HTML (`report.html`) formats and are also stored in `output/documents/`.  
  
**`cleanData.R`** - This script does a lot of the initial heavy lifting. It reads the raw data file in and cleans it up for future processes. The columns (variables) are renamed and a few new variables are created. The modified data is then sliced into chunks corresponding to the different General Education core competencies. These data files are stored as comma-separated value (`*.csv`) files in `output/data`.

**`makeSpreadsheets.R`** - This script reads in the `*.csv` data files that were generated by `cleanData.R` and creates Excel workbooks for each unique CRN. Folders for each core competency are created in `output/workbooks` and each of the generated spreadsheets are stored in the correct location.  

**`sendEmails`** - This script also reads in the `*.csv` data files that were generated by `cleanData.R` and generates an email message to the instructor of each unique CRN. The workbooks created by `makeSpreadsheets.R` are automatically included as email attachments.
